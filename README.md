A recipe site meant for teaching HTML and CSS in Odin Project

This is the start of my journey of re-learning HTML, CSS
& JavaScript! So far, I have been introduced into Git
fully as well as having created a dual boot between
Windows and Linux's Ubuntu. So far, the changes
have been pretty interesting to learn, to say the least
and even though it was a tad more difficult in the beginning
to get used to Ubuntu, I was better for it in the end.
